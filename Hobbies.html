                Here you will see that I have a lot of pets, I workout and one of my hobbies is <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockfighting" target="_blank">Cockfighting</a>,
                for me being fan of Cockfighting is more of a tradition also passed down from generation to generation since my grandfather on mother side is also a big fan of that sport.
                Now me and my father also is a big fan of Cockfighting. I may not engage in basketball or nay other sports but I am a big fan of Cockfighting. But even though, I still workout
                and the type of workout that i do is <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calisthenics" target = "_blank">Calisthenics</a>. And if you wish to know me better you can always contact
